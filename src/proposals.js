    earning stable rewards due to energy as a fairly consistent segment.`},

    NFTstreamz.tv is a new project based in Manchester, UK. The concept is to give new avenue streams to streamers and viewers. <p/>
    Users can stake their Lition/NFTS tokens to obtain NFT's that are used to post EMOJI/MEMES into chat channels. 
    These are the only images users can post into the channel. Users can freely trade these NFT's on the market with a % of the sales going to the dev team. 
    <p/>Side chains will be utilised to enable streamers to create their own NFT's and profit from the resale value on them. 
    
    <p/>The team consists of 4 people. Myself, a CTO, Head of Design & Head of Marketing. The funding will be used obtain more developers to steam roll the project forward and a portion to add liquidity to Uniswap. Locked and unlocked tokens will be portioned out into different pools should this idea gain traction. The project is fairly new and is in early stages. This transition will enable us to speed up the pipelines and enable the community too have a new lease of life on their investment. 
    
    <p/>We recognise the strong community here and will build a new, more rewarding brand.

    { id: 3, name: "DEFI + Contract NFT",  description: `Our team suggests using our developments to create a new product
    together with the Lition community.<br />
    The main features of the project are: multi-blockchain DeFi, using the
    advantages of scaling, speed and low cost of transactions of the new
    blockchains, while maintaining the popularity of Ethereum.<br />
    <p />
    We will also build a new direction of using validated contracts of
    real entities in NFT for trading them as collateral in DeFi, where
    companies like Lition can wrap their energy contracts as NFT and make
    them tradeable.
    <p />
    The members of the project are Anton Erashov, an economist currently
    defending Ph.D in cryptocurrencies, previously taking part in various
    crypto projects (https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-erashow/), Evgeny
    Usorov, Software Engineer with many years of experience in Java /
    JavaScript technologies and with experience in crypto and blockchain.
    (https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeny-usorov-344698199/) and other
    developers.
    <p />
    After the launch of the project, which we are planning about 6 months,
    Lition tokens will be exchanged for new DeFiCo tokens with 1 : 1. At
    the same time, the initial fixed price of tokens is planned to be $ 1
    with a restriction on price changes until the project reaches the 2.0
    working stage and with a gradual transition to floating pricing. In
    our version, for LIT holders, it will be important to support us in
    voting and then track the news of the project's implementation. Later
    through a smart contract you will be able to automatically replace
    your LITs with DeFiCo tokens on the announced date (closer to the
    public launch of the project).

    <p />
    Itâ€™s planned to open the office in Berlin closer to the technical
    launch of the project and having a legal status: Limited company
    (GmbH). There will be also first planned validations of NFT contracts
    for launching in DeFi trading, with the subsequent development of a
    network of offices throughout Europe and the world.` }
